# This is my future portfolio, where i'll showcase all my works. 

Development Map: 
- adding basic functionality and design;
- adding content for the main page;
- adding other pages for each menu option
- tweaking the main menu to include all the list items necessary to showcase my projects and aquired skills;
- improve css to display another color scheme (if it's the case); 
- adding responsiveness with basic js/python.
